# About

FELion GUI is a desktop application built using [Tauri](https://tauri.app) and [Svelte](https://svelte.dev) as a front-end and [python](https://python.org) as a back-end.

## Tauri

Tauri is a framework for building lightweight, secure, and fast desktop applications using web technologies such as HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. It is designed to be easy to use and allow developers to build native-like applications that can be deployed on multiple platforms, including Windows, macOS, and Linux.

One of the main features of Tauri is its ability to create applications that are both web-based and natively installed on the user's device. This allows developers to leverage the power and flexibility of the web while also providing a native experience for the end user.

## Svelte

Svelte, on the other hand, is a JavaScript framework for building user interfaces that allows developers to write efficient and expressive code that compiles to small, standalone modules.

By using Tauri and Svelte together, developers can create powerful and performant desktop applications that leverage the strengths of both technologies.

## Other technologies

It would not have been possible to build this software without the usage of other open-source web technologies such as vite, rollup, and many other CSS and JS libraries.
