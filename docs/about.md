# About

FELion GUI is a desktop application built using [Tauri (v1.2)](https://tauri.app) and [Svelte (v3)](https://svelte.dev) as a front-end UI/UX and [Python (v3.11)](https://python.org) as a back-end for scientific computational purpose.

## Front-end

### Tauri [:material-open-in-new:](https://tauri.app){:target="_blank"}

Tauri is a framework for building lightweight, secure, and fast desktop applications using web technologies such as HTML :fontawesome-brands-html5:, CSS :fontawesome-brands-css3:, and JavaScript :fontawesome-brands-js:. It is designed to be easy to use and allow developers to build native-like applications that can be deployed on multiple platforms, including Windows, macOS, and Linux.

One of the main features of Tauri is its ability to create applications that are both web-based and natively installed on the user's device. This allows developers to leverage the power and flexibility of the web while also providing a native experience for the end user.

### Svelte [:material-open-in-new:](https://svelte.dev){:target="_blank"}

Svelte, on the other hand, is a JavaScript framework for building user interfaces that allows developers to write efficient and expressive code that compiles to small, standalone modules.

By using Tauri and Svelte together, developers can create powerful and performant desktop applications that leverage the strengths of both technologies.

### Other technologies

It would not have been possible to build this software without other :material-scale-balance:{ .lg .middle } __Open Source__ technologies such as [vite](https://vitejs.dev/){:target="_blank"} and [plotly](https://plotly.com/javascript/){:target="_blank"}, and many other CSS and JS libraries.

## Back-end

### Python [:material-open-in-new:](https://python.org){:target="_blank"}

The computational processes in the FELion program are heavily depend on python, especially NumPy and Scipy libraries.

Python is a popular programming language that is widely used in scientific computing. It is known for its simplicity, readability, and flexibility, making it a great choice for data analysis and numerical computations.

Python has a large and active community of users and developers, which has led to the creation of many libraries and frameworks that facilitate scientific computing tasks.

Two of the most commonly used libraries for scientific computing in Python are NumPy and SciPy. NumPy is a library for working with large, multi-dimensional arrays and matrices of numerical data, while SciPy is a library that provides a collection of algorithms and functions for scientific computing tasks, such as optimization, linear algebra, and statistics. Together, these libraries provide a powerful toolkit for scientific computing in Python.
